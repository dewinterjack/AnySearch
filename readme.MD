A search tool for searching through any inputted website. 
I think my default chrome skin is showing that nice font, find out if that is the case and what font it is so I can actually use it for the site. 

Are all sites able to handle this kind of search?
How many requests would be needed?

This may not be possible: A custom search engine with the site to be searched must be created. May not be able to dynamically search any site.
